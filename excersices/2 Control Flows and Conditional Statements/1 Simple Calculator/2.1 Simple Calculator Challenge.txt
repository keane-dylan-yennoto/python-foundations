Excercise 2.1: Simple Calculator

Write a Python program that takes two numbers, a and b, and a simple mathematical symbol as input from the user.
However an additional twist is that this must be done forever till the user ask to stop. 

The program should perform the corresponding mathematical operations: 

    '+' for addition, 
    '-' for subtraction, 
    '*' for multiplication, 
    '/' for division

on the numbers a and b, and display the result.

Example output:

=== Simple Calculator ===
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 3
Enter the mathematical symbol (+, -, *, /): *

Result: 15.0

=== Simple Calculator ===
Enter the first number: 1
Enter the second number: 3
Enter the mathematical symbol (+, -, *, /): +

Result: 4.0

=== Simple Calculator ===
Enter the first number: stop

End of Program


Notes:

    I encourage to always try to code first!

    Don't look at the hints or the solutions at first.
    After getting stuck then try please check the hints and code again.
    Still stuck? then open the solution and code again. Never give up!

    My solutions might be different from yours and thats okay!

    Programming essentially is getting outputs from inputs

    input -> black box -> output

    the black box might be different as long as it answers the problem question its still great!

    side note: its fun to see how different people approach different problems.
