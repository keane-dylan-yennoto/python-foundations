Exercise 4.1: Movie Titles

Write a Python program that takes a string and checks 
whether if it is a valid movie title.

If the movie title is valid then the program will output the movie title only.
If not then the program will try to fix the movie title and output the two possible valid formats.

A movie title is valid if it is in:

- All Caps:
    Some titles may use all capital letters for stylistic reasons or to emphasize the title.
    Example: "JAWS", "PULP FICTION."

- Title Case: 
    This style capitalizes the first letter of each major word in the title, including nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns. 
    Articles (e.g., "a", "an", "the"), conjunctions (e.g., "and", "but", "or"), and prepositions (e.g., "in", "on", "at") 
    are not capitalized unless they are the first or last word in the title. 
    
    Examples: "The Great Gatsby", "Gone with the Wind"

    For title case the inputs are limited to:
        - Articles: 'a' , 'an', 'the'
        - Conjunctions: 'and', 'but', 'or'
        - Prepositions: 'in', 'on', 'at', 'with', 'from', 'of
    Any other words apart from these are considered nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns.

The input test cases only contains alphabetic characters.

Test Case examples:
    - "The Great Gatsby" -> Valid
    - "Gone With the Wind" -> Not Valid -> Transform to valid -> "Gone with the Wind"
    - "In an Open Room" -> Valid
    - "With and from You" -> Valid
    - "A horrible tragedy" -> Not Valid -> Transform to valid -> "A Horrible Tragedy"
    - "Moving TEN steps fOrwArd" -> Not Valid -> Transform to valid -> "Moving Ten Steps Forward"

Examples:


Example 1:

    Enter The Movie Title: In an Open Room
    (True, 'In an Open Room')

Example 2:

    Enter The Movie Title: the Inner Workings Of me
    (False, 'The Inner Workings of Me')
