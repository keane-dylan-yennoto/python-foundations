Exercise 3.1: Word Frequency Counter

Write a Python program that takes a paragraph of text as input from the user 
and counts the frequency of each word in the paragraph.

The program will display a list of unique words along with their corresponding frequencies.

Example :

=== Word Counter ===
Enter a text: Hello world. Hello Python. Python is great!

Word Frequency:
- hello: 2
- world: 1
- python: 2
- is: 1
- great: 1

Notes:

    I encourage to always try to code first!

    Don't look at the hints or the solutions at first.
    After getting stuck then try please check the hints and code again.
    Still stuck? then open the solution and code again. Never give up!

    My solutions might be different from yours and thats okay!

    Programming essentially is getting outputs from inputs

    input -> black box -> output

    the black box might be different as long as it answers the problem question its still great!

    side note: its fun to see how different people approach different problems.
