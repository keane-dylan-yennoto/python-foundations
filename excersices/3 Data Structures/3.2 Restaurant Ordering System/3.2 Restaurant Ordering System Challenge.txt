Exercise 3.1: Word Frequency Counter

Write a Python program that code inputs from a menu item index and outputs:
1. The amount of items ordered by item menu
2. The total price per item
3. The total price of the bill

Example :

=========================
Welcome to my Restaurant
Our menu:
1. Cheese Burger $12
2. Steak $34
3. Sandwich $5
4. Coke $3
5. Ice Tea $3
6. stop
What's ur order :3
What's ur order :4
What's ur order :5
What's ur order :5
What's ur order :1
What's ur order :6
=========================
Here is your bill:
Cheese Burger 1 x $12 = $12
Sandwich 1 x $5 = $5
Coke 1 x $3 = $3
Ice Tea 2 x $3 = $6
Total Price: 26

Challenge Notes:

    Try to make your code generalizable. 
    Which means that if the menu changes it is still able to complete the objective of 

    Taking inputs from a menu item index and outputs:
        1. The amount of items ordered by item menu
        2. The total price per item
        3. The total price of the bill

Notes:

    I encourage to always try to code first!

    Don't look at the hints or the solutions at first.
    After getting stuck then try please check the hints and code again.
    Still stuck? then open the solution and code again. Never give up!

    My solutions might be different from yours and thats okay!

    Programming essentially is getting outputs from inputs

    input -> black box -> output

    the black box might be different as long as it answers the problem question its still great!

    side note: its fun to see how different people approach different problems.
