Exercise 3.2: Restaurant Ordering System

Write a Python program that code inputs from a menu item index and outputs:
1. The amount of items ordered by item menu
2. The total price per item
3. The total price of the bill

Example :

=========================
Welcome to my Restaurant
Our menu:
1. Cheese Burger $12
2. Steak $34
3. Sandwich $5
4. Coke $3
5. Ice Tea $3
6. stop
What's ur order :3
What's ur order :4
What's ur order :5
What's ur order :5
What's ur order :1
What's ur order :6
=========================
Here is your bill:
Cheese Burger 1 x $12 = $12
Sandwich 1 x $5 = $5
Coke 1 x $3 = $3
Ice Tea 2 x $3 = $6
Total Price: 26
=========================

Challenge Notes:

    Try to make your code generalizable. 
    Which means that if the menu changes it is still able to complete the objective of 

    Taking inputs from a menu item index and outputs:
        1. The amount of items ordered by item menu
        2. The total price per item
        3. The total price of the bill
