Exercise 1: Store Calculator

Write a program that acts as a simple store calculator. 

The program should take the name, price, quantity, and discount percentage of an item from the user 

You will need to calculate the total price and the total price after applying the discount. 
Both prices should be printed to the nearest second decimal place


Example Output:

=== Store Calculator ===
Enter the item name: Apple
Enter the item price: 0.5
Enter the item quantity: 10
Enter the discount percentage: 20

=== Receipt ===
Item: Apple
Price per item: $0.50
Quantity: 10
Total price: $5.00
Total price after discount: $4.00

Notes:

    I encourage to always try to code first!

    Don't look at the hints or the solutions at first.
    After getting stuck then try please check the hints and code again.
    Still stuck? then open the solution and code again. Never give up!

    My solutions might be different from yours and thats okay!

    Programming essentially is getting outputs from inputs

    input -> black box -> output

    the black box might be different as long as it answers the problem question its still great!

    side note: its fun to see how different people approach different problems.
