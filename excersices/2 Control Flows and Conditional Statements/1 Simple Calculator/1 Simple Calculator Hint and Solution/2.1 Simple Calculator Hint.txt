To solve this excercise, you can use the following steps as a guide:

- Use a while loop to always repeat the code below.
- Display a welcome message and ask the user to enter two numbers and a mathematical symbol.
- Use the input() function to get the user's input for the numbers and the symbol.
    - if the input() is 'stop' then break
    - and Display "End of Program"
- Convert the numbers to the appropriate data type (e.g., int or float).
- Use an if-elif-else statement to perform the corresponding mathematical operation based on the symbol entered.
- Display the result to the user.
