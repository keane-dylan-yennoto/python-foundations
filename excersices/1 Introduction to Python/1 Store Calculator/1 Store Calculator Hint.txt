To solve this exercise, you can use the following steps as a guide:

- Display a welcome message and ask the user to enter the item name, price, quantity, and discount percentage.

- Use the input() function to get the user's input for each value.

- Convert the price, quantity, and discount percentage to the appropriate data types (e.g., float, int).

- Calculate the total price by multiplying the price and quantity.

- Calculate the total price after applying the discount by subtracting the discount amount from the total price.

- Display the receipt with the item details, total price, and total price after discount.

- Note: You can format the output to display the prices with a specific number of decimal places, 
        such as using the :.2f format specifier for two decimal places.
