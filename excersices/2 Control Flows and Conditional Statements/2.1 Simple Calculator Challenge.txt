Excercise 2.1: Simple Calculator

Write a Python program that takes two numbers, a and b, and a simple mathematical symbol as input from the user.
However an additional twist is that this must be done forever till the user ask to stop. 

The program should perform the corresponding mathematical operations: 

    '+' for addition, 
    '-' for subtraction, 
    '*' for multiplication, 
    '/' for division

    on the numbers a and b, and display the result.

Example output:

=== Simple Calculator ===
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 3
Enter the mathematical symbol (+, -, *, /): *

Result: 15

=== Simple Calculator ===
Enter the first number: 1
Enter the second number: 3
Enter the mathematical symbol (+, -, *, /): +

Result: 4

=== Simple Calculator ===
