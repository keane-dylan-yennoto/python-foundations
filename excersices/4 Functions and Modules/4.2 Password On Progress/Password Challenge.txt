Exercise 3.1: Password

Buckle Up! This is gonna be a challenging one.

Write a Python program that alows you to save & check passwords with hashing.

A crash course on passwords:

Passwords are typically stored in databases using a process called password hashing. 
The main idea behind password hashing is to convert the user's password into a 
unique and irreversible representation before storing it in the database. 

This way, even if the database is hacked, the actual passwords remain unknown.
